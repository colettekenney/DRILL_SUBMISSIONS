    "<b>Data Source</b>: Amsterdam availability data scraped from AirBnB on December 24th. <b>Question</b>: What are the popular neighborhoods in Amsterdam?\n",
    "\n",
    "### My Answer\n",
    "Because the data is pulled on December 24th it could be skewed towards popular areas of the city that people like to go to around Christmas.\n",

    "\n",
    "Christmastime will bias availability in two ways- more AirBnBs may be taken due to vacationers, or fewer AirBnBs may be on offer because people don’t want to share their homes over the holidays. Choose a sampling period that doesn’t include a major holiday, or reframe the question to focus on popular neighborhoods during major holidays."

    "\n",
    "### My Answer\n",
    "This is the day after 911 in New York City. The comparison of data from New York to San Fran would be affected by the fact that New York just went through a major terrorism attack and crisis, which as a result could skew the patterns of people accessing metnal health services. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Thinkful's Answer\n",
    "*Mental health services use on September 12, 2001 in San Francisco, CA and New York City, NY: Given the terrorist attack on NYC the day before, patterns of mental health services use are likely to be very different in the two cities-- even if they were pretty similar on September 10, 2001. Reframe the question to mental health use in the aftermath of a nearby vs distant crisis, perhaps."
